                <h2>Heuristic Evaluation Workbook</h2>
                <p>This section presents a summary of the usability evaluation conducted on the Library Management System. The primary objective of this evaluation was to assess the system’s interface with regard to usability, focusing on factors such as effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Several usability issues were identified, affecting different areas of the system's design and user interaction flow.</p>
                <p>The evaluation process followed Jacob's 10 Heuristic Evaluation method, a widely recognized framework that employs ten usability principles to systematically identify and assess interface design issues. These principles enabled a structured analysis of the system, revealing both minor inconsistencies and more significant usability barriers that could impede user performance and overall experience. </p>                 
                <p>The evaluation has revealed critical insights into areas of the Library Management System that require improvement. The findings provide a valuable foundation for guiding future design revisions, with the goal of enhancing usability and ensuring a more seamless and user-centered experience.</p>

                                <p>The system fails to provide timely and clear feedback for user actions such as logging in or deleting records. It does not highlight the current location within the interface, and lacks confirmation messages, which can leave users uncertain about what has occurred or what steps to take next.</p>

                                <p>The date picker combines years and months in a single list, which disrupts the expected order and makes it harder for users to select dates. Presenting years separately and in sequence would make the selection process more intuitive. Additionally, the burger icon is not functioning, preventing users from accessing the main navigation menu. This limits usability and should be fixed to ensure smooth and efficient navigation.</p>

                    <p>The system has many problems that make it hard to use, especially for new users. It doesn’t give clear feedback, uses confusing words and icons, and lacks important features like undo, help guides, and shortcuts. Errors are often unclear and the design feels messy and overwhelming. </p>
                    <p>These issues can cause users to make mistakes, feel lost, and waste time doing simple tasks. To improve, the system needs to be more user-friendly, clear, and supportive at every step.</p>
