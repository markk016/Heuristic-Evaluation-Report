                            <p>"For our final HCI2 project, our five-member team conducted a heuristic evaluation of a Library Management System using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics and created a web reporting site. Each member assessed the system individually, identifying key usability issues such as unclear feedback, confusing language, and lack of user control features like “cancel” or “undo.” Based on our evaluations, we proposed improvements to enhance the system’s usability. Tasks were divided according to individual strengths, and we collaborated effectively to complete the project. Overall, it was a valuable and rewarding hands-on learning experience.

                            <p>"I found the library system useful, but it still needs improvements. It was able to handle basic tasks
like adding books. However, I encountered a problem: I could add a book once, but if I tried to add it
again, an error would occur, preventing the action. I also noticed issues such as missing feedback
messages after certain actions, confusing warnings, and unclear error messages. Some expected features
were not fully functional, and the interface could be more user-friendly and consistent. As a group, we learned how to properly evaluate a system using usability principles. Each of us
evaluated the system to test different features, point out issues, and suggest improvements. This helped us
better understand the importance of user experience and how small changes can make a big difference. It
also gave us experience in teamwork, communication, and critical thinking while reviewing a real system."</p>

                        <li><strong>Evaluation Methods:</strong> We'll combine heuristic evaluation with other usability testing methods for more comprehensive assessments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We'll continue to refine our approach to documenting usability issues and proposed solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We'll leverage the diverse perspectives within our team for more thorough evaluations.</li>
